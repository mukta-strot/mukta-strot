# geographical maps in Marathi (digital and printable)

The idea here is to use [openstreetmap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) data to make geographical maps which has map information displayed in Marathi.

## 1. Static and bounded maps
Create individual maps for different places such as cities, towns, villages etc. [Reference here](https://draftmpd41.github.io/).
These maps will be static and bounded in a certain area. Imagine individual webpages that display maps of just 1 city/town/village or a part/combination of it.
- static means the map can be zoomed in and out, but only for viewing purpose.
- filters can be applied to show/hide certain types of data
- bounded means boxed in a area (like say, a box of 20km x 10km)

High resolution printing of these maps should be possible.

## 2. Dynamic map
Another option is to re-use the [OSM Indic map](https://osm-in.github.io/indic-map) (repo [here](https://github.com/osm-in/indic-map)) to make something similar (if possible better) but also geared towards making hi-res printable maps.
