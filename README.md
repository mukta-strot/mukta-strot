some other projects/ideas that are right now in my head -

- geographical maps in Marathi (digital and printable)
- star maps (astronomical maps) in Marathi (digital and printable)
- a printable multilingual "handbook for pregnant mother and child care". (multilingual
  means you can choose and print the book in any (or multiple) Indic languages you want.)

### Goal

1. To improve and promote the use of unadulterated Marathi among its existing speakers.
2. To create information resources and tools which will help with goal \#1.
