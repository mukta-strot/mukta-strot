## About

**Mukta-strot** is Marathi translation of English "**open-source**". 

All the information and tools you find here are free (as in freedom) and their source is open.

Open source means you can see how something was made, and free means you can modify it as per your needs and distribute it to others.

### Inspiration

- This project is mainly inspired by the challenges that I experienced and the 
realisations that I had in the past couple of years. *(I will write it in detail
sometime later.)*
